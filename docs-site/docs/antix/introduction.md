# Antix

**Antix** is Antigma's LLM Proxy, Identity Provider, and Organization Manager — the collaborative backend that makes AI scalable, secure, and reliable for teams.

While [Ante](/) delivers autonomous AI capabilities to your local terminal, Antix is the control plane: a unified gateway that routes models across multiple wire protocols, governs organizations, issues budget-capped keys, and tracks AI spend across your company.

### Key features

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Multi-protocol gateway" icon="route">
    Speaks OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages, and Gemini native on the same base URL. Point any existing SDK at Antix with one line of config.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hard-budget virtual keys" icon="shield-halved">
    Issue scoped `sk-antix-…` keys with atomic `max_budget` caps per day, month, or lifetime. Strict enforcement blocks overruns before upstream is called.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ante control plane" icon="plug">
    Governance for local coding agents. Start `ante`, type `/connect`, and select Antix to securely authenticate your local agent, attributing every prompt.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)" icon="key">
    Send your own provider credentials in `Authorization` and declare the provider with `X-Antix-Provider`. Antix routes and meters without re-billing.
  </Card>

### Why Antix?

- **Fail-closed by default.** If the billing backend is unreachable, Antix refuses to serve traffic.
- **High-performance hot path.** A streaming pipeline normalizes SSE across providers, and atomic budget enforcement is guaranteed under concurrent load.
- **Multi-tenant from day one.** Organizations, RBAC (`admin` / `member`), and scoped virtual keys — not bolted on.
- **Honest about retention.** Antix persists request and response bodies for cost attribution and admin analytics — see [Privacy, Security & Data Retention](/antix/concepts/security).
